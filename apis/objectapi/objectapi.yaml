  description: >- 
    The Object API resource is used to store the data.
      - Primarily supports data storage and other related operation.
      - Allows you to define your own repository inside sunbird and use the same to perform operations on data.
      - an object can be used in different contexts, it depends on how it is implemented
      - Each object entity has its own unique payload request parameters
      - Refer to the relevant documentation on Sunbird website for getting the exact object payload parameters
