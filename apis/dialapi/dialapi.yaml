  title: D.I.A.L code API(s)
  description: >-
    The D.I.A.L Code (Digital Infrastructure for Augmented Learning) API resources are used for energising the textbooks.
     - D.I.A.L code allows textbook creators to tag various pages and topics in a flexible manner using the DIAL codes (in QR code format) and these codes can be linked with digital content, thus providing easy access for the end users and a seamless physical to digital transition.
