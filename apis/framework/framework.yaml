  title: Framework API(s)
  description: >-
         The Framework API resources is basically a supporting data structure which serves as a template. It can be used in places where the structure remains the same but only the usage changes are per requirement. These resources are used to create, update, search, frameworks, channels, catergories, terms.
            - The Hierarchy is as: Framework-->Category-->Terms
              - Category: An abstract classification of the terms   partitioned according to requirement.
              - Terms: Refers to a keyword or a phrase to descibe a Concept
