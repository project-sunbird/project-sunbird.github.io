  title: Framework API(s)
  description: >-
         The Framework API resources is basically a supporting data structure which serves as a template 
        
         - It can be used in places where the structure remains the same but only the usage changes are per requirement
         
         - These resources are used to create, update, search, frameworks, channels, catergories, terms
            - The Hierarchy is as: Framework-->Category-->Terms
              - Category: An abstract classification of the terms partitioned according to requirement
              - Terms: Refers to a keyword or a phrase to descibe a Concept
