## What is Sunbird?
Sunbird is a next-generation scalable open-source learning solution for teachers and tutors. Built for the 21st century with state-of-the-art technology, Sunbird runs natively in cloud/mobile environments. The open-source governance of Sunbird allows a massive community of nation-builders to co-create and extend the solution in novel ways.

## What is the project mission?
Project Sunbird has a mission to improve learning outcomes for 200 million children across India. This is a multi-dimensional problem unique to the multi-lingual offline population of India (and other developing countries). It's not a problem of any single organization or stakeholder and it cannot be realistically addressed by individual effort. 

Project Sunbird is a multi-year, multi-stakeholder open, iterative and collaborative approach to bring together the best minds in pursuit of this audacious goal.
