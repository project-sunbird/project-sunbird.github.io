## My Workspace

Sunbird provides you with a workspace that is only yours. Once you have your own unique profile, you can start using your workspace to create, curate, review, upload and publish different types of  content artifacts using the customizable content editor. You can save your drafts, send them for a review, flag an issue, rework on them as often as you like until you publish it for use by the community.
