On Sunbird there are different types of users. The tasks and responsibility of each user varies according to the role they are assigned on the portal.
For example, the responsibility of a course creator is to create a course while a course reviewer reviews a created course.

Similarly, a system administrator on Sunbird has specific roles. Only system administrator has the right to add organization types on the portal. Once these organization types are added, the organization administrators can upload other organizations and users. Organization type can vary according to requirements. Any number of organization type can be added on Sunbird.
