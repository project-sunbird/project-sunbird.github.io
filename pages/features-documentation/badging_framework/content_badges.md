## Overview
Badging plays a critical role in the creation and curation of content and courses. Badging content is primarily useful in
organizing, searching and recommending suitable content. It enables increased content usage. Organization administrators, on Sunbird, can create and assign badges to content. Organizations can create any badge titles such as Popular, Recommended etc. For more details on creating badges, refer Creating Badges.

In this documentation, for the pupose of explaining the process of issuing badges to content we have used the example of a badge, titled, Official.
