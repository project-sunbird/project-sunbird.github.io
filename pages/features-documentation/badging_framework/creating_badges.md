## Overview

Organization administrators can create and customize badges to suit their organization needs. This page provides you information on the procedures to:
- Create badges
- Create badge Issuers
- Define created badges in the platform

### Prerequisites

To create badges on Sunbird, ensure you have: <br>1. Sunbird API keys <br>2. Access to Badging Framework APIs <br>3. Any standard rest API client, for instance, Postman <br>4. Subtypes configured in your local system. The existing subtypes are: <br>&emsp;a) Awards <br>&emsp;b) Certificates <br>&emsp;c) Authorizations <br>&emsp;d) Endorsements

### Defining Badge Issuers

Every badge must be issued by a designated badge issuer. Organizations can have individual issuers for each created badge or one issuer for all the badges created. To create a badge issuer: <br>1. Open your rest API client <br>2. Load the badging framework APIs in the client <br>3. Set the Sunbird API authorization token to execute the badging framework APIs for creating a badge issuer
