For effective functioning of an organization, it is necessary to control and distribute responsibilities across users appropriately. Sunbird has multiple user types. All the portal members are Users. 

Based on user responsibilities, rights are provided to: 

- create 
- review 
- publish 
- consume

Specific users are granted administration rights to manage users or organization profile creation, onboarding, deletion, passwords, and site look-and-feel customization.
