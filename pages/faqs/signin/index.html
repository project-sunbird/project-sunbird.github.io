<h2 id="signin">Signin</h2>

<p><strong>How can you register and get user credentials to sign in to the platform?</strong></p>

<p>The platform has the provision to register and provide user credentials (user ID and password) to: 
- Individual users (users that do not belong to any organization), and 
- Organizational users (users that are part of an organization)</p>

<p>The states and organizations make a policy decision to allow / disallow registering single individual users.</p>

<p>Contact your organization administrator for details</p>
