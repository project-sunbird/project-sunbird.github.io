Term | Definition |Usage/Example
-----|------------|-----------------
Domain | An area or range of knowledge, learning or information | Knowledge and learning can be classified using multiple filters - by subject, grade, competency or skill areas. On Sunbird, a Domain is associated with multiple frameworks; e.g. Elementary Education, Science, Pedagogy, B.Ed, etc.
Taxonomy    |A pre-determined classification that provides an unambiguous conceptual framework. The classification describes and separates mutually exclusive categories and subcategories of topics. Taxonomies help individuals and search engines find and retrieve information and content.  |  On Sunbird, all content pieces must have metadata such as a title, description and other identifying elements that classify and aid the flow of content. Sunbird’s inbuilt taxonomy improves search results and helps users discover relevant content. It also helps the system automatically recommend content based on user profile and preference, thus enhancing user experience.
Metadata    |Information about data (content piece) that further qualifies and describes the it. This information is not part of the content body, but is stored in the backend. It helps search engines search and discover content.    |Sunbird enforces users to add metadata for each piece of content created or uploaded on the platform. Some metadata is mandatory, while some is optional. For example, each content piece, must have a Title, while the author’s name is optional.
Searchability   |The ability of a human, system or computer to explore or examine, to find information.  |When users type in keywords to search on the platform, Sunbird search engine gets the most relevant and appropriate results in the fastest time.
Discoverability |The ability of a human, system or computer to find out or unearth that which was previously unknown.    |Sunbird has a unique search algorithm that uses its pre-defined taxonomy to show content that is associated with the keywords specified.
content |Expression and elucidation of a thought using speech, writing, images, or any other art.    |On Sunbird, content can be standalone or a compilation of study material units. The study material can be in video, audio, text or multimedia format. It can be created or uploaded on the platform. All content must have a learning outcome.
Vocabulary  |A list of words or phrases, used in a defined context. The vocabulary may differ when the context changes. For example; ‘The house plan submitted to the authorities did not fit in with the government’s plan to develop the area. |Sunbird has a vocabulary that covers universally known learning concepts or objectives. Every content piece on the Sunbird is tagged with one or many vocabulary words. The vocabulary words are associated with frameworks. E.g. Addition, Nouns, Plant Life, Pedagogy, Classroom Management.
Tags    |Tags and metadata are synonyms. Any content piece can have multiple tags.   |On Sunbird, tags associated with content make it easily searchable. There are five broad categories of tags mandated by the content editor and during content upload: - Content Description, - File Related, - Ownership and Audience, - Area Specific Fields, - Additional/User Defined, - Tags/Keywords
framework   |A structure designed to define the scope of something.  |In the context of Sunbird, the framework is defined through a string of vocabularies, arranged to achieve a learning outcome. There are two types of frameworks: -Teacher Competency, eg. CENTA, B.Ed, - Curriculum Framework, eg. NCF, MSCERT, ICSE, CBSE.
