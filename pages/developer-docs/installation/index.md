## Plan, Install and Configure Sunbird 
The deployment of Sunbird in a live environment requires several distributed components. Before you start installation, please understand the following possibilities:

### Try Sunbird

If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test its feature set, we recommend you use the [Sunbird sandbox](https://staging.open-sunbird.org/){:target="_blank"} which is hosted in the cloud. 

**Note: Data created in the sandbox is erased every 24 hours**

### Extend Sunbird

If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you [Developer Installation](developer-docs/installation/developer_installation/){:target="_blank"}. This allows you to get started quickly and help extend the Sunbird.

### Deploy Sunbird for your users

If you plan to install Sunbird for your users, we recommend you follow the [Server Installation](developer-docs/installation/server_installation/){:target="_blank"} process.
