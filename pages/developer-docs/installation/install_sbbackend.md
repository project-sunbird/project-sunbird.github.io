## Overview

The purpose of this section is to assist you:

  - With installing the Sunbird backend on your local machine 

Also, if you are interested in Testing:

  - Sunbird backend services
  - API workflows

## Sunbird Backend Services

To set up the Sunbird Back-end services, follow the steps chronologically:

1.	Setup
2.	Configure back-end service stack

### Setup

Before configuring the services, ensure the installation of following dependencies:
     
  - Apache Cassandra ver-3.10
  - Elasticsearch ver-5.4.0
  - Keycloak ver-3.2.1. Final
  - PostgreSQL (required only when you wish to run quartz scheduler in distributed environment, not recommended on local machines)

Let us set up the environment and then proceed with deploying the services.

**Setup Cassandra** 
 
1. For step by step installation guide, refer to the official [website](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html){:target="_blank"}
2. The official website guides you through the installation, and if you have done a successful install of Cassandra, now you need to        start the server and open Cassandra CLI (Command Line Interface) 
3. Run [cassandra.cql](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-mw/blob/master/actors/src/main/resources/cassandra.cql){:target="_blank"} file to      create the required keyspace, tables and indices
4. Copy the following files to a temp folder in a Cassandra installed machine 
    
    - [PageMgmt.csv](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-mw/blob/master/actors/src/main/resources/pageMgmt.csv){:target="_blank"} 
    - [PageSection.csv](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-mw/blob/master/actors/src/main/resources/pageSection.csv){:target="_blank"} 
              
 Example:  ```/tmp/cql/pageMgmt.csv and /tmp/cql/pageSection.csv ```

5. Execute the following commands 

<pre>
cqlsh -e "COPY sunbird.page_management(id, appmap,createdby, createddate, name, 
organisationid, portalmap, updatedby, updateddate) FROM '/tmp/cql/pageMgmt.csv'"
 cqlsh -e "COPY sunbird.page_section(id, alt, createdby, createddate, description,
 display, imgurl, name, searchquery, sectiondatatype, status, updatedby, updateddate) 
 FROM '/tmp/cql/pageSection.csv'"
</pre>
Next section details about setting up the Elastic search on your local machine.

**Setup Elastic search**

  1. For step by step installation guide of Elastic search refer to the official [website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html){:target="_blank"}

  2. The official website guides you through the installation, and if you have done a successful install of Elastic search, you need to start the server and open Elastic search CLI (Command Line Interface)

  3. Run the following curl command

<pre>
curl -X PUT \
http://localhost:9200/searchindex/org/ORG_001 \
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'postman-token: caa7eaa7-2a08-d1f3-1eb2-bf7c73bef663' \
-d '{}'
</pre>     

Next section details about setting up the Keycloak on your local machine.

**Setup Keycloak**

1. For step by step installation guide of Keycloak refer to the official [website](http://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_installation/topics/installation/distribution-files-community.html){:target="_blank"} 

2. The official website guides you through the installation, and if you have done a successful install of Keycloak, now you need to start the server 

3. To start the Keycloak server, navigate to “Bin” Directory and run the standalone file. Performing this action will start the Keycloak server 

4. You can access the Keycloak admin console on ```http://localhost:8080``` 

5. For Public key, navigate to Realm settings tab -> Keys -> Public Keys 

6. For sending welcome email when a user registers, you need to configure email server by navigating to: Realm Settings tab -> Emails (optional)

The table mentions all the environment variables with description. Add or edit the environment variables in their appropriate locations.

**Note:** The following environment variables are mandatory to run the backend services.

### Setting Environment Variables

To run sunbird backend services, at least you need to set the following environment variables. Ensure that you set the environment variables at appropriate locations.

<pre>
1. sunbird_cassandra_host
2. sunbird_cassandra_port
3. sunbird_cassandra_username 
4. sunbird_cassandra_password 
5. sunbird_es_host
6. sunbird_es_port
7. sunbird_learner_actor_host
8. sunbird_learner_actor_port
9. sunbird_sso_url
10. sunbird_sso_realm
11. sunbird_sso_username
12. sunbird_sso_password
13. sunbird_sso_client_id
14. ekstep_content_search_base_url
15. ekstep_authorization
16. sunbird_installation : name of environment in which you are running the application or instance name
17. sunbird_quartz_mode : set value as "embedded" as you are not running scheduler in distributed environment.
18. sunbird_sso_publickey
</pre>
   
For remaining environment variable values[refer] (https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-utils/blob/master/common-util/src/main/resources/externalresource.properties){:target="_blank"}

## Configuring and running Back-End Services Stack

You can configure the Backend service by following these instructions:

- Cloning the repositories
- Making the Build
     
### Clone the Repositories
          
   - [sunbird-utils](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-utils){:target="_blank"}
   - [sunbird-lms-service](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-service){:target="_blank"}
   - [sunbird-lms-mw](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-mw){:target="_blank"}

     
### Making the build

Make the builds in following order:

   - sunbird-utils
   - sunbird-lms-mw
   - sunbird-lms-service

## Configuring the (Akka) Actors

Sunbird architecture supports two Akka actor systems: 
     	
  1. Normal ActorSystem 
  2. Background ActorSystem 


By default, both run on different machines. In order to run these actor systems on a single machine, you need to modify the [resource.properties file]
For more details [refer](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-utils/blob/master/common-util/src/main/resources/externalresource.properties){:target="_blank"} to this repository.


To run both the actor systems on a single machine follow these steps:

  1.	Open **externalresource.properties** file
  2.	Modify the following properties:
         
          - background_actor_provider
          - api_actor_provider
  
  3.	Set value of both properties as “local”
  4.	Run ```mvn clean install``` command to make build of each module

To run the **sunbird-lms-service** execute the following command
    
      ```mvn play2:run```

## Testing the services 
  
Test any API using postman, e.g. download **user API** and perform different actions on user using this [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/d314ef7df8fb02c9fa0f){:target="_blank"}
