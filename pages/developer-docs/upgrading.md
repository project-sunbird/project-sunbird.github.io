   	`./cassandra_restore.py --host <cassandra_host_ip_address> <snapshotdir>`
    
    for example: `./cassandra_restore.py --host 10.10.10.10 cassandra_bakup`

### Restore Elastic Search

To restore the Elastic Search databases, follow these steps: 

1. Copy the backup file from `/tmp/elasticsearch-backup/<backup_file>` to the instance where you want to run the restore operation.

2. Run the following command: 	

	`./restore_elasticsearch.sh <path/to/the/restore_file`	

### Restore Postgres

1. Copy the backup file from  **/tmp/postgresql-backup/<backup_file>**

2. Run the command `./restore_postgres.sh`  
	
## Upgrading Sunbird Services 

   1. Pull the latest code of `project-sunbird/sunbird-devops` from its master branch or tag, follow **a or b**
     
   - a. pulling the latest code in same folder
   
        `git -C sunbird-devops pull || git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops`
        
        update the config file if necessary
     
  - b. if you don't want to deal with merge conflicts, clone a fresh repo, create a new directory
	
	`git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops`
	`git checkout <tag>/<branch>`
	
	update values for `deploy/config` file
	
   2. Run the followig commands

   <pre>
   cd sunbird-devops/deploy 
  ./sunbird-install.sh -s config
  ./sunbird-install.sh -s dbs
  ./sunbird-install.sh -s apis
  ./sunbird-install.sh -s core
   </pre>

**Note:** 

   - Executing the command deploys the latest version of Sunbird services and also updates the latest schema in the databases

   - The latest image versions of all the services are updated in the master branch. To get a hotfix image of any Sunbird service, update the minor version in the `sunbird-devops/deploy/version.env` file and re-run the `sunbird-devops/deploy/deploy-core.sh` script.
