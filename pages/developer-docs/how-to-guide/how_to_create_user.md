## Scenario

XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organization's administrator needs to create and add user details. 

### Prerequisites

1.An initialized server instance of Sunbird. Initialization includes creating an org admin user (through Keycloak), creating a channel and associating a first organization with the channel.

For details, refer to:
* [Server Installation](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/installation/server_installation/)
* [Channel APIs](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/framework/#tag/Channel-APIs)
* [First organization](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/initialization) associated with channel ID

2.The API Key for access and basic authentication

3.An API client to make API calls. For example use Postman refer [Using Postman] (http://www.sunbird.org/apis/framework/#tag/usingpostman)

4.Access to the [Create User API](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/userapi/#tag/User-APIs)

## Overview

Every user belongs to an organization and is identified within the organization through a unique user ID. Sunbird, uniquely identifies every tenant organization through a channel. Hence, when creating a user, its not enough to only add user details and assign a user ID. To enable users, the user ID has to be associated with an organization and channel. Since a user also plays a role within an organization, the user gets fully enabled only after the user ID is associated to a role. For example, John is a manager in XYZ corporation, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them.  

### Taskflow
 
Only an org administrator can create users. Follow the sequence of steps provided to create a general user: 

1. Ensure that all prerequisites are met 
2. Use postman or curl command to execute Sunbird's Create User API
3. Specify values in the Create User API header   

Field | Sample Value 
--- | ---|
content-Type | appilcation/json
Authorization| JWT token with keyword "Bearer" example: {Bearer JWT Token}

4.Specify values for the following parameters in the request body of the API 

**Note:** 
i)While you may provide values for other parameters in the request body, it is essential to provide values in those mentioned in the following table. For more information, refer [User Create API](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/userapi/#operation/Create%20User)
