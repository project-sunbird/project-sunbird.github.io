## Overview

On installation,  users can explore and work with Sunbird.  The installation process takes care of the default minimum configuration required to run Sunbird. However, if you want to customize your instance of Sunbird, it is simple.
Modify default behaviour or the look and feel by overriding the default values of environment variables as mentioned in the following table.
For example, you can change the default logo to the logo of your choice, or  change the default email address to your preferred email address.

**Note:** If you have not installed Sunbird, refer to [Server Installation](\pages\developer-docs\installation\server_installation)
