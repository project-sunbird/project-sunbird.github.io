The objective of the configuration section is to provide a simple, but flexible way for anyone to get an instance of Sunbird up and running that is fully configured and ready-to-go.

- Before getting started, it is recommended to refer [Installation options] (pages\developer-docs\installation) page to see which deployment method is right for you. 

**Note:** For details about installations, refer to subsequent Developer Installation{:target="_blank"} or Server Installation{:target="_blank"} pages.

- Upon successful installation, your sunbird instance must be configured to make it fully operational. There are several configuration steps that you must complete before you can seamlessly experience and explore Sunbird, for example: set up environment variables, set up public key etc.
