Sunbird's developer documentation is meant for its adopters, developers and contributors.   

The developer documentation helps you to get familiar with the bare necessities, giving you a quick and clean approach to get you up and running. If you are looking for ways to customize the workflow, or just breaking things down to build them back up, head to the reference section to dig into the mechanics of Sunbird APIs.

Sunbird is based on an open platform, you are free to use any programming language to extend or customize it. To try the Sunbird APIs, a basic understanding of REST APIs and a knowledge of object-oriented design principles is a plus, though not necessary.

The Developer documentation provides you with a complete set of guidelines which you need to:

   - Install Sunbird
   - Configure Sunbird
   - Customize Sunbird
   - Extend Sunbird
   - Contribute to Sunbird

Go to the [Getting Started](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/getting_started/){:target="_blank"} page to get your instance of Sunbird up and running.
