## Overview
The main purpose of [OpenSaber](https://github.com/project-sunbird/open-saber/wiki) is to serve as an electronic registry for entities such as  teacher registry, doctor registry etc. OpenSaber can be used by Sunbird adopters to store custom information about their organization users, user profile data extensions, organisation data extensions etc.

### Customization
OpenSaber maintains information in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) graph data format. [SHEX](https://shex.io/) is used to define the schema of data stored in OpenSaber. The SHEX schema definition can consist of one or more entities e.g. user, organisation etc. whose information can be stored within OpenSaber. 

Currently all interactions with OpenSaber is in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format while Sunbird LMS APIs are in JSON format. A java library (OpenSaber Client) is available for transforming between JSON-LD and JSON formats. Additionally, Sunbird provides a java library for bridging between OpenSaber equivalent JSON and Sunbird API specified JSON format.

To support customization of an entity within Sunbird, the following definitions are required:

1. Definition of the entity using SHEX (OpenSaber). For more details refer [OpenSaber](https://github.com/project-sunbird/open-saber/wiki)

2. Define mapping to transform between JSON-LD and JSON format (OpenSaber Client). For more details refer [OpenSaber](https://github.com/project-sunbird/open-saber/wiki)

3. Define mapping to transform between OpenSaber Client JSON and Sunbird JSON format (Sunbird OpenSaber Bridge). This includes updation of following files within [Sunbird OpenSaber Bridge](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-open-saber-bridge)

a) **registry-user-write-mapping.conf**: Configuration to map Sunbird User Create and Update API request JSON format for required extensions (i.e. custom fields) into OpenSaber Client JSON format

Currently Sunbird only supports customisation of users

Add configuration for every custom field in below format. This configuration definition is as per typesafe format

~~~

<customType> {
    <customFieldName> {
        <propertyName>: <propertyValue>
        ...
    }
}

~~~



Property Name  | Field Type  | Description
-------------- | ----------- | -----------
fromFieldName  | Optional    | Field name which identifies input of transformation. If not specified, _<customFieldName>_ is used
toFieldName    | Mandatory   | Field name which identifies output of transformation  
fromType       | Mandatory   | Type of from field name
toType         | Mandatory   | Type of to field name
fromDateFormat | Optional    | Date format of input if from field type is DateString
toDateFormat   | Optional    | Date format of output if to field type is DateString
filters        | Optional    | Filter for selecting an element to transform from an input of type _List<T>_
filterField    | Optional    | Field to use from selected element in transformation



**Note**:

- Supported types are _Integer_, _Double_, _Long_, _Boolean_, _String_, _DateString_ and _List<T>_

- In _List<T>_ type, _T_ can be a simple type (e.g. _String_) or a custom type. A custom type can be defined in the configuration

- _filters_ is applicable only if _fromType_ is _List<T>_ and _toType_ is other than list type

- _filterField_ is applicable only if _fromType_ is _List<T> and _filters_ is specified

- _filters_ has the following format. This filter can be used to select an element having specified field name with specified value

~~~
[{field = <fieldName>, values = [<valueName>]}]
~~~

b) **registry-user-read-mapping.conf**: Configuration to map OpenSaber Client response JSON format for required extensions into Sunbird User Read API JSON format 
The configuration format for read mapping is similar to write mapping. The difference between read and write mapping is due to the input. In case of read, the input is OpenSaber Client response JSON whereas in case of write, the input is Sunbird API request JSON format
c) **registry-user-enums-mapping.conf**: Configuration which defines enumerations required for mapping between Sunbird User API JSON format and OpenSaber Client JSON format
The configuration format for enums is as given below:

~~~
enums {
	<customEnumName1> {
		"<sunbirdEnumValue1.1>" = "<openSaberEnumValue1.1>"
		"<sunbirdEnumValue1.2>" = "<openSaberEnumValue1.2>"
		...
	}
	<customEnumName2> {
		"<sunbirdEnumValue2.1>" = "<openSaberEnumValue2.1>"
		"<sunbirdEnumValue2.2>" = "<openSaberEnumValue2.2>"
		...
	}
}
~~~

Listed are some examples to illustrate configuration of user customisation.
__Example 1__: Define configuration for a user with a custom field _schoolCode_ of simple type

**registry-user-write-mapping.conf**

~~~
user {
	schoolCode {
		toFieldName	= "teacher.schoolCode"
		fromType	= "String"
		toType		= "String"
	}
}
~~~


**registry-user-read-mapping.conf**

~~~
teacher {
	schoolCode {
		toFieldName	= "schoolCode"
		fromType	= "String"
		toType		= "String"
	}
}
~~~

**Sunbird API JSON format**

~~~
{
	"schoolCode": "KV101"
}
~~~

**OpenSaber Client JSON format**

~~~
{
    "teacher": {
    	"schoolCode": "KV101"
    }
}
~~~

__Example 2__: Define configuration for a user with a custom field _highestAcademicQualification_ of _List<T>_ type, where _T_ is a simple type

**registry-user-write-mapping.conf**
	
~~~
user {
	highestAcademicQualification {
		toFieldName	= "teacher.highestAcademicQualification"
		fromType	= "List<String>"
		toType		= "List<String>"
		enum		= "academicQualificationEnum"
	}
}
~~~

**registry-user-read-mapping.conf**

~~~
teacher {
	highestAcademicQualification {
