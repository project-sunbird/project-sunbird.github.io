*  **I want to try Sunbird**
	If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the [Sunbird sandbox](https://staging.open-sunbird.org/){:target="_blank"} which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.
*  **I want to extend Sunbird**
	If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the process [Developer installation]
	(developer-docs/install_wantextsbcontent_p6.md)
	This will get you started quickly so you can start extending Sunbird.
* **I want a medium scale deployment of Sunbird**
	If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the process [Medium scale deployment]
	(developer-docs/install_medscdepcontent_p7).This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.
* **I want a large scale deployment of Sunbird** If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10k+ users, we recommend you follow the [large-scale deployment process] (developer-docs/install_largescdepcontent_p8).This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.
